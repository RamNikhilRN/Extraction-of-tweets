ABSTRACT:   
         This project is about “EXTRACTION OF DATA” from offline and online. This project gives Information about a huge amount of data given by users all around the world, Therefore we started to collect the required data from some social networking sites like (Twitter, Facebook). This is mainly used in Major sources of abundant data like Business: Web, e-commerce, transactions, stocks, Science: Remote sensing, bioinformatics, scientific simulation, Society and everyone: news, digital cameras are used. For gathering information about a particular topic and much more. It is one of the basic methodologies in data extraction. We can also analyze what’s app chat data. Presently Data extracted in the English language.  It just gives the data it doesn’t give the user name, time, date.
        In global languages according to the user requirement. From what’s app chat data we can make sentiment analysis. We can make frequently messaged words from the chat data. We can make a total count on sentiment. Date and time can be obtained from what’s app chat data. The mean of message length and sender details can be obtained. Plotting of data from a particular date and time can be done.


It is one type of data mining.

Existing system:

->Latterly this proposal was done, likely in the Mid-winter season of 2015.                          
->The Existing system has limited lines of extracting nearly 50 tweets.                       
->The existing system has more lines of code using python.                         

Using New features and the R programs is more simple.                                                                     
->In our project, we have increased the size of extracting tweets to nearly 500.                         
->we made tweets to be extracted in multiple languages(global languages).                             
->But using R Language we can do it in fewer lines.                                           



Software Requirements:                          
->R studio                              
->Twitter (package)                               
->Rcurl (package)                                   
->Twitter API Keys                                               
->R studio Supported OS(Windows, Linux, Macintosh, etc;)                 

Hardware Requirements:                             
•An Intel-compatible platform running Windows 2000, XP/2003/Vista/7/8/2012 Server/8.1/10.                          
•At least 32 MB of RAM, a mouse, and enough disk space for recovered files, image files, etc.                             
•The administrative privileges are required to install and run R-Studio utilities under Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/2012 Server/8.1/10.                      
•A network connection for data recovering over a network.                     


It is done using R language I have already created the UI using shinny and now we need to get twitter developer API keys and paste them into the code. 
we can get the keys from here: https://developer.twitter.com/
